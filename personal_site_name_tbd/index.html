                    Are you tired of having to research in all sorts of different places just to find tips and guides on how to level up your jobs quickly in Final Fantasy XIV? On this site, you can find guides on how to get to level 50 in Fishing and Mining, in a matter of minutes (if the right conditions are met). It is highly recommended that you have your "A Realm Reborn" MSQs finished before starting either guide.
                    <br><br>
                    Each guide will give a comprehensive step by step process on how to reach your desired level goal incredibly quickly, with links to relevant WIKI pages to make locating the necessary NPCs, locations, and tools require zero prior game knowledge.
                    <br><br>
                    Some general exp tips before you start either guide:
                    <br><br>
                    It is incredibly useful to gain the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Road_to_80" class="eorzeadb_link">"The Road to 80"</a> buff to earn double exp up until level 80 on each class and job. If you don't already have this buff, it can be obtained for 90 days upon transfering your character to a Preferred World. Typically, it is completey free to transfer yourself to a Preferred World.
                    <br><br>
                    It is also worthy of note that food will give a 3% exp boost upon consumption. This increase in exp gain is so minimal however, that unless you're going for a record, the time saved is not worth the effort of obtaining food.
