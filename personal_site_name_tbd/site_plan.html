        Are you tired of having to research in all sorts of different places just to find tips and guides on how to level up your jobs quickly in Final Fantasy XIV? On this site, you can find guides on how to get to level 50 in Fishing and Mining, in a matter of minutes (if the right conditions are met). It is highly recommended that you have your "A Realm Reborn" MSQs finished before starting either guide.
        <br><br>
        Each guide will give a comprehensive step by step process on how to reach your desired level goal incredibly quickly, with links to relevant WIKI pages to make locating the necessary NPCs, locations, and tools require zero prior game knowledge.
        <br><br>
        Some general exp tips before you start either guide:
        <br><br>
        It is incredibly useful to gain the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Road_to_80" class="eorzeadb_link">"The Road to 80"</a> buff to earn double exp up until level 80 on each class and job. If you don't already have this buff, it can be obtained for 90 days upon transfering your character to a Preferred World. Typically, it is completey free to transfer yourself to a Preferred World.
        <br><br>
        It is also worthy of note that food will give a 3% exp boost upon consumption. This increase in exp gain is so minimal however, that unless you're going for a record, the time saved is not worth the effort of obtaining food.

      <h3>Level 50 Fishing</h3>
      <p>
        In this guide, not only will I be teaching you how to reach level 50 in fishing, but I'll teach you how you can reach it without needing to catch more than a couple of fish by hand. It all revolves around the Leve system. The following is a step by step guide, which depending on if you have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Road_to_80" class="eorzeadb_link">"The Road to 80"</a> buff or not, can take only between 15-40 minutes total. This process will also go much faster if you have completed your <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/?category2=0&category3=1" class="eorzeadb_link">"A Realm Reborn" MSQs</a> to unlock flight in all non-dlc regions, as well as having your main job above level 50. Every 10 levels, you may want to go back to Sisipu to do job quests, as it rewards us with a nice small boost in exp, gil, and better gear.
        <br><br>
        1-10: Complete Fishing job quests up until level 10. The fishes necessary for these quests are incredibly easy to catch yourself, but if you'd like to avoid doing any fishing at all, most of the fishes can be purchased from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/72f2e4e6607/" class="eorzeadb_link">Holafhis</a> in Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks for very cheap. If he doesn't have them, they can be purchased from the market, which can be accessed from any market board.
        <br><br>
        10-20: After reaching level 10, we can start doing fishing levequests to level up from now on. The level 10 levelquests are all given by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/npc/npc/1b003985d2d/" class="eorzeadb_link">Swygskyf</a> at Swiftperch in Western La Noscea. His coordinates are (x34,y31). Please note: if you are unable to recieve levequests, it's because you must do an introductory levequest in that region to unlock the ability to accept more leves in said region. All of the fish necessary for these levequests can be purchased from the market board, if not from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/72f2e4e6607/" class="eorzeadb_link">Holafhis</a>. Keep repeating these Levequests until you reach level 20, which should take at most 5, and only a couple repeats if you have the "The Road to 80" buff.
        <br><br>
        20-30: After hitting level 20, we can move onto the level 20 levequests! These are given by Nyell at Quarrymill in South Shroud. His coordinates are (x25,y20). None of the required fish will be purchasable from a vender, so you must buy them all from the market board. This is where the process may begin to get pricey. If the fish you need for a particular leve isn't available on the market, you can simply cancel that leve, and repeat the ones that are doable. It will be much easier to find all of the fish you need if you are visiting a highly populated server with a very busy market during this process. Repeat these levequests until you reach level 30.
        <br><br>
        30-50: Level 30 leves are offered by Nahctahr at Costa del Sol in Easter La Noscea, coordinates (x30,y30). Level 40 leves are given by Voilinaut at Whitebrim Front in Coerthas Central Highlands, coordinates (x12,y16). If you feel it's necessary to go to higher level leves after reaching level 45, you may get level 45 leves from K'leytai at Saint Coinach's Find in Mor Dhona.
        <br><br>
        You should now be above Level 50 in fishing!

      </ul>
      <h3>lvl 50 Mining</h3>
      <p>
        Reaching level 50 in Mining should take you between 1-2 hours, depending on if you have the "The Road to 80" buff active. It is highly recommended that you have finished "A Realm Reborn", as you'll need to have unlocked levequests in multiple regions, and flight will make the process go much faster. The process of completing levequests as a miner is very guided and easy. I recommend completing the job quests as you unlock them to get better gear. The job quests can be made much easier by buying the required items at a market board.
        <br><br>
        1-10: Talk to Linette to get the "Way of the Miner quest". By the time you finish the first two quests, you should be level 5 so you can do level 5 job quest. If you aren't going to be level 5 by the end of those quests, make sure to mine a little extra to make sure you will. Do the same to reach and complete the Level 10 quest.
        <br><br>
        10-20: Now we can get started on levequests! Level 10 levequests are offered by Totonowa at Horizon in Western Thanalan, coordinates (x23,y16). Repeat these levequests until you reach level 20.
        <br><br>
        20-30: We're going to repeat the same process but with levequests offered by Nyell at Quarrymill in South Shroud, coordinates (x25,y20). Nyell is really convenient, as he offers both level 20 and level 25 levequests!
        <br><br>
        30-40: We're now moving on to levequests from Nahctahr at Costa del Sol in Eastern La Noscea, coordinates (x30,y30).
        <br><br>
        40-50: Level 40 levequests are offered by Voilinaut at Whitebrim Front in Coerthas Central Highlands, coordinates (x12,y16), and level 45 levequests are offered by K'leytai at Saint Coinach's Find in Mor Dhona, coordinates (x29,y12).
