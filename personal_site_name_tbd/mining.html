            Reaching level 50 in Mining should take you between 1-2 hours, depending on if you have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Road_to_80" class="eorzeadb_link">"The Road to 80"</a> active. It is highly recommended that you have finished your <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/2ba6b3e60da/" class="eorzeadb_link">final "A Realm Reborn" MSQ</a>, as you'll need to have unlocked levequests in multiple regions, and flight will make the process go much faster. The process of completing levequests as a miner is very guided and easy. I recommend completing the job quests as you unlock them to get better gear. The job quests can be made much easier by buying the required items at a market board.
            <br><br>
            1-10: Talk to Linette to get the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/248c325292d/" class="eorzeadb_link">"Way of the Miner" quest</a>. By the time you finish the first two quests, you should be level 5 so you can do <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/0d1fc042f62/" class="eorzeadb_link">level 5 job quest</a>. If you aren't going to be level 5 by the end of those quests, make sure to mine a little extra to make sure you will. Do the same to reach and complete the <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/1704716ac5d/" class="eorzeadb_link">level 10 job quest</a>.
            <br><br>
            10-20: Now we can get started on levequests! <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/c4ed1e8736c/" class="eorzeadb_link">level 10 levequests</a> are offered by Totonowa at Horizon in Western Thanalan, coordinates (x23,y16). Repeat these levequests until you reach level 20.
            <br><br>
            20-30: We're going to repeat the same process but with levequests offered by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/f40244a5e96/" class="eorzeadb_link">Nyell at Quarrymill</a> in South Shroud, coordinates (x25,y20). Nyell is really convenient, as he offers both level 20 and level 25 levequests!
            <br><br>
            30-40: We're now moving on to levequests from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/03143813074/" class="eorzeadb_link">Nahctahr at Costa del Sol</a> in Eastern La Noscea, coordinates (x30,y30).
            <br><br>
            40-50: Level 40 levequests are offered by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/2c695ae8a6f/" class="eorzeadb_link">Voilinaut at Whitebrim</a> Front in Coerthas Central Highlands, coordinates (x12,y16), and level 45 levequests are offered by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/67c527d0faa/" class="eorzeadb_link">K'leytai at Saint Coinach's Find</a> in Mor Dhona, coordinates (x29,y12).
