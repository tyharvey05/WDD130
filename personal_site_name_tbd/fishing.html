            In this guide, not only will I be teaching you how to reach level 50 in fishing, but I'll teach you how you can reach it without needing to catch more than a couple of fish by hand. It all revolves around the Leve system. The following is a step by step guide, which depending on if you have the <a href="https://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/The_Road_to_80" class="eorzeadb_link">"The Road to 80"</a> buff or not, can take only between 15-40 minutes total. This process will also go much faster if you have completed your <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/2ba6b3e60da/" class="eorzeadb_link">final "A Realm Reborn" MSQ</a> to unlock flight in all non-dlc regions, as well as having your main job above level 50. Every 10 levels, you may want to go back to <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/npc/npc/f942d1cf9a6/" class="eorzeadb_link">Sisipu</a> to do <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/ddf6f8d8969/" class="eorzeadb_link">Job Quests</a>, as it rewards us with a nice small boost in exp, gil, and better gear.

                    <p>Complete Fishing job quests up until level 10. The fishes necessary for these quests are incredibly easy to catch yourself, but if you'd like to avoid doing any fishing at all, most of the fishes can be purchased from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/72f2e4e6607/" class="eorzeadb_link">Holafhis</a> in Limsa Lominsa Upper Decks for very cheap. If he doesn't have them, they can be purchased from the market, which can be accessed from any market board.</p>

                    <p>After reaching level 10, we can start doing fishing levequests to level up from now on. The level 10 levelquests are all given by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/npc/npc/1b003985d2d/" class="eorzeadb_link">Swygskyf</a> at Swiftperch in Western La Noscea. His coordinates are (x34,y31). Please note: if you are unable to recieve levequests, it's because you must do an introductory levequest in that region to unlock the ability to accept more leves in said region. All of the fish necessary for these levequests can be purchased from the market board, if not from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/shop/72f2e4e6607/" class="eorzeadb_link">Holafhis</a>. Keep repeating these Levequests until you reach level 20, which should take at most 5, and only a couple repeats if you have the "The Road to 80" buff.</p>

                <div class="panel">
                    <p>After hitting level 20, we can move onto the level 20 levequests! These are given by <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/f40244a5e96/" class="eorzeadb_link">Nyell at Quarrymill</a> in South Shroud. His coordinates are (x25,y20). None of the required fish will be purchasable from a vender, so you must buy them all from the market board. This is where the process may begin to get pricey. If the fish you need for a particular leve isn't available on the market, you can simply cancel that leve, and repeat the ones that are doable. It will be much easier to find all of the fish you need if you are visiting a highly populated server with a very busy market during this process. Repeat these levequests until you reach level 30.</p>

Level 40 leves are given by Voilinaut at Whitebrim Front in Coerthas Central Highlands, coordinates (x12,y16). If you feel it's necessary to go to higher level leves after reaching level 45, you may get level 45 leves from <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/db/quest/67c527d0faa/" class="eorzeadb_link">K'leytai at Saint Coinach's</a> Find in Mor Dhona. You should now be level 50 fishing!</p>
